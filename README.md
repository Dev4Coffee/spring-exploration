# spring-exploration

This is a learning repository to remind me to put everything into practice I came along about spring. I have been an active spring developer for 3 years now, but it took that long for me to finally take the decision to go for the spring developer exam. Although the certification's value is of course debatable, the knowledge is invaluable. For me it is about getting a tight, concise understanding of the inner workings of spring.

If you are interested, have a look!
